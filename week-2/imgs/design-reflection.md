What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
The six phases of web design are information gathering, planning, design, development, testing and delivery and maintenance. 

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
My site's primary purpose is to sell a product, therefore my sight will feature individual pages for each product, as well as a contact page to buy the product, and an 'about me' page for company transparency. 

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My site's target audience are those who have have a passion to use my product along with those who have the money to buy my product. My site addresses them by allowing immediate access to the 'product' page to buy the product, and immediate access to the 'about' page to provide transparency of who I am. 

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? 
The primary action I want users to take is to look at my product, know who I am, and contact me if they want to buy. 

Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? 
I want them to search for information and contact me as I have made these the primary actions.

It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
There is no way of appeasing everyone. A change to make the UX experience better for one person will have the opposite affect for another. Finding a middle ground the makes the most people happy is key in UX design. 

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
User experience is about how a person feels when interfacing with a system. UX is about the usability and accessibility that an end user feels when using your product. Designing the optimal UX to address these questions is what UX design is all about. Those who work on UX study and evaluate how users feel about a system, looking at ease of use, perception of value of the system, followed by efficiency in performing tasks.  

What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
UX addresses the questions of: Does this website give me value? Is it easy to use? Is it pleasant to use? These are key if you want to generate a user base and have your user base keep coming back to your sites.  

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
The part of the challenge I found most tedious was answering all the reflection questions.
