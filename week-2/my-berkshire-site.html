- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	It was an amazing epxerience, the first HTML site I've ever coded. The repetition of steps in the directions really made me learn the tagging process. 

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	I really enjoyed learning about semantic HTMl5 elements. I always heard the word "HTML5", but never knew what were the changes it brought. Semantic elements bring a whole new update of HTML semantic tags and their acoompanying rules, these rules the future of HTML. 

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	I did a good job, I adheared to this rule and completed the assignement. I hope I did a good job. 

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
- 	HTML is fairly easy to learn and simple to read. However, it's capabilities are limited and syntax laboring to type sometimes. 

What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	All elemernts are containers inside containers inside ever bigger containers, in other words HTML is like a fractal of conainers.
