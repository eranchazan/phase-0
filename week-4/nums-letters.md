What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a whole number.  A float is an integer followed by a decimal point.

What is the difference between float and integer 
division? Float division returns the number, followed by the decimal point, followed by the remainder. Integer division looses any remainders. 

How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
In real life, integers are used in programs the majority of the time. However, for programs used for e.g. physics experiments floats have been invented for more precise calculations in computer programs.   

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
Ruby handles addition, subtraction and multiplication in a very straightforward manner. All you need is two operands and a operator. With division, however, no remainders will show unless you specify that the variable is a float. 

What is the difference between integers and floats?
An integer is a whole number.  A float is an integer followed by a decimal point.

What is the difference between integer and float division?

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
Strings hold and manipulate a specific set of bites, i.e. characters. 

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
Local variables are variables only known by the application you are in i.e. local scope. You would want to use them when you want to maintain modularity in your code. In other words, you want your variable to not be recognized by code outside your application.

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
I loved this challenge, it was straightforward. I got a great review of the basics.
