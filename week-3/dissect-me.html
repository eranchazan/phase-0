				The benefits of version control are plentiful. Some examples are as follows.  It allows you to go back to ealier versions of your code, to maintain multiple versions of your code, to see the difference between two (or more) versions of your code, to review the history of some code, to submit a change to someone else's code, to share your code, or let other people work on your code, to see how much work is being done, and where, when and by whome, and lastly to experiment with a new feature without interfering with working code.

				Git helps you keep track of your changes by logging every commit that has been made. A commit is a log of each change to the repository. Each commit comes with a brief header line that summarizes the purpose of the commit. Information such as why it was done along with by whom and when is written are here. Following the header line is the body paragraph (separated by a empty line) that goes into more detail about why the commit was made and what the code means.

					You should store your code on GitHub because it will never be lost since it's on the cloud. It is password protected to keep all your code safe. It enables you to get help if you need it by allowing others who you give access to to look at it and make changes with their own versions of your code. And lastly it is how employeers today hire. Today they look at your GitHub account like a resume by viewing your code and seeing your abilities.

					What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
					I used the <section> <main>, as well as (but not showed in this particular assignment) the <footer> and <aside> tags. I use these tags often becuase it always makes reading HTML documents much easier to parse and study. 
					
					How do elements get laid out on a page? 
					Elements get laid out on a page with the tags such as <section>      <footer> and <aside> tags being the highest level element containers. Within these elements are the more specific tags such as <p> or <span> that add even more specific styling to those of their parent elements. Essentially elements are laid out on a page in a hierarchical structure. 
					
					What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
					The browser displays elements with the elements lower down on the CSS document overriding those written before it (higher up on the CSS document). If two different elements target one text, then both elements's effects are carried out. You can even target child elements inside parent elements, or sibling elements for styling. 

					What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? 
					What I learned about Sublime from this assignment is how to open Sublime from terminal, how to create shortcuts inside Sublime with snippets, as well as how to fix element indentions via edit->line->indent or unident.

					Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
					I will definitely create more snippets in the future. Snippets save a lot of time and labor. I will also research already existed snippets because it will save me the time of creating new ones!
