Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To create a repo in GitHub you need to go to github.com followed by logging into your account (if you don't have one then create one). In the upper right corner of your profile screen you'll see a plus sign, click on it and select 'new repo'. Give your repo a name, make it public or private depending if you want others to freely access your repo. Initialize a license to stipulate how you want your code shared and used. Finally, click on the green button that says "create repository". 
To clone a repo on GitHub go to the repo main page. In the lower left corner is the URL for the repo, copy it. Then type in your command line: git clone and the URL you just copied. 


Describe what open source means.

Open source means the source code of a product is free and open to the public for viewing and experimenting with, i.e. improving it. It is also open for free unlimited redistribution.


What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

Open source is a new paradigm in our current technological age. I think it can be very benefitial in creating wonderful projects and services. However, it also could take away jobs and therefore hurt our society. I get a little nervous about Open Source becuase I don't think we know what the long term affects of it will evolove into. The jury is still out in my mind if it is a utopia. 

Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licensing is very important because it protects the hard work of those who want to keep their efforts private, and at the same time allows Open Source projets access to scale up by enabling large numbers of developers to gain access to the source code. This degree of flexibiity only realisticlly possible on a societal scale via licenses. 



What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

Concepts that were solidified during this challenge were creating new feature branches, cloing, staging, committing, and deleting old branch files. Additionally, my ability to create repos, clone repos, and merge repos also was also strengthened. 
I had many small "aha" moments after countless repetitons of reading the instructions and practicing myself.
