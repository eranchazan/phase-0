  Some time management and productivity ideas I learned are firstly the Pomodoro technique, that is the practice the breaking up your day in 25 minute intervals for different tasks along with setting up personal objectives for your day. Secondly, focusing on what makes me feel great, that is learning what makes me feel motivated and fulfilled, Thirdly, learning to set countless micro-goals to accomplish a task thereby optimizing the chances of success. And lastly, learning to think in a "Growth Mindset", that is having the philosophy that one has the ability to become better at something with practice. This viewpoint thus removing doubt and self-criticism that prevents me from getting work done.             

   Time Boxing is a method of working toward a goal with consistent breaks that allow for self-reflection and time to reassess one's progress and goals. I can apply this in Phase 0 by pacing myself when learning the vast amounts of material I will need to master, and to put some perspective in my journey at DBC.        

    Currently I manage my time by setting goals of completing two or three DBC exercises a day. My strategy works half the time. It doesn't work because some of the assignments take longer than expected, while others take shorter amounts of time. I will employ the Pomodoro technique to get a better understanding of exactly how long certain types of task take, and take appropriate planning action thereafter. I will also learn to not be so rigid and take breaks when I'm struggling to concentrate, while maybe doing more exercises than planned in one day if I'm in the "flow."

   My overall plan for time management in Phase 0 is to use all the techniques learned in the articles I read to make sure I have enough time to reflect on all material given. Not only is reading and practicing the material important, but the practice of meditating and refactoring material learned is as critical in creating long-term retainment of the information.

A unix shell is a command line interpreter program that acts as an intermediator between the user and the inner workings of the computer.                                                                                                  

A bash is a specific type of unix shell command line language used as a default for Mac OSX.            

The most challenging aspect of going through this material was creating compound commands, along with remembering every command presented to me.                    

I was not successful 100% of the time using all the commands. Sometimes files could not be found and I couldn't figure out why. 

The most important commands to know for starters are mkdir, ls, less, and cd. All these commands are rudimentary in getting basic knowledge of my files, and getting my code up and running. Additionally the * command is import for batch processing. 

pwd: to print a directory 

ls: to list the content of my directory.

mv: to move a file by renaming it 

cd: to change a directory

../: to move up a tree or path

touch: to make an empty file 

mkdir: make a directory 

less: to view a file

rmdir: to remove a directory 

rm: to remove a file 

help: to get the name of a command when you know what the nature of it does

1. Create your repository on your personal GitHub account. Do this by clicking on the plus sign in the upper right corner of your screen, give your repository a title, and lastly make it public (to allow others to view your work) give it a MIT license (to allow for instant cloning) followed by clicking the 'create repository" button. 

2. Next fork a copy of the p0-cli-exploration repository to your GitHub account (thereby giving your account a copy of the p0-client-exploration repo). You do this by clicking the fork button in the upper right corner (you may need to select your username following this). You'll now see in your GitHub account at the top of the page your username slash the name of the forked repo (in this case p0-cli-exploration). Your work will now only affect your version and not the original.                                                                                                  

3. Now that we have the forked repository on your GitHub account (i.e. it is still in the cloud but not on your computer) you want to clone it to your actual computer through git. To do this we type: 1.) git  2.) clone 3.) the url of the repo from GitHub. Do this also with your Phase 0 repo. You can now create and experiment with as many versions of the repos as you want on your computer without touching the newly cloned repos you just attained from GItHub.   

To delete a local repo you type in the rm command line or more specifically rm -rf to make sure all files are deleted in the repo.  

You want to fork a repository instead of creating a new one because forking allows you to share code instead of always starting from scratch on your own, thereby saving tremendous amounts of time. You can take code that has already been written and just modify the content you want to focus on. It also allows you to share your code with others.   

Struggles that I had setting up Git and GitHub were learning the basic command lines and on a more general level learning conceptually what I'm doing. What I learned in this process is that repetition  is key to nailing down the basics.
