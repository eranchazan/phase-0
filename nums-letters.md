What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is a whole number.  A float is an integer followed by a decimal point.

What is the difference between float and integer 
division? Float division returns the number, followed by the decimal point, followed by the remainder. Integer division looses any remainders. 

How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
In real life, integers are used in programs the majority of the time. However, for programs used for e.g. physics experiments floats have been invented for more precise calculations in computer programs.
