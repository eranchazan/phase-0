What is a one-to-one database?
A relationship between two entities in which they share a single relationship to one another, essentially like a pair i.e. a nucleus and an atom. 
When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
The general rule of thumb is to use a one-to-one relationship if you have a a relationship  where a group of fields that can all optionally be empty or null. 


What is a many-to-many database? The relationship between two entities such as A and B. A may contain a parent record for which there are many children in B and B can have a parent element with many children elements of A.  

When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created). You would create a many-to-many relationship When one or more rows in a table are associated with one or more rows in another table.

What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense? What is confusing about databases is still learning one hundred percent what a one-to-one v. one-to-many v. many-to-many means. What is clear is knowing how to link tables together with the primary/foreign keys.
